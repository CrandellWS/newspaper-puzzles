<h2>NPP-Crossword<br /><span class="subtitle">(NewsPaper Puzzles.)</span></h2>

<p>Thanks for trying the crossword puzzle portion of the Newspaper Puzzles application! The Crosswords section doesn't include any crossword puzzles out of the box, but you will next be offered to download puzzles from the last 10 days for you to solve. They will appear in the puzzle list once the downloads are complete. If you want downloads to be automatic you will have to select this in the preference options.</p>

<p>Network connection is required to play crosswords as the games become available via downloads, and downloads will fail without a network connection. If this is the case, you can try again later by selecting the "Download" option available by pressing the Menu button on the selection screen.</p>
