<h2>Puzzle Archive Scraping (Experimental)</h2>

<p><b>Cru Cryptics/Kegler's Kryptics</b> The Cru Cryptics and Kegler's Kryptics archives 
contain a ton of puzzles. If you enable
this source, NPP-Crosswords will download three new puzzles from each of them every time you start a download. This
is likely best used with the auto-download feature turned off.</p>

<p>This is an experimental feature right now and may be removed.<p>
