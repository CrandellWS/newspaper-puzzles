        <string name="ws_tutorial_message">In WordSearch, your goal is to find all of the words in the word list.  There are two ways that you can find words:</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message2">Drag and Tap both use the touchscreen. Drag is selected by default, but you can switch between Drag and Tap by going to the menu and picking \"Input Type.\"</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_drag1">Using your finger, touch the first letter of a word.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_drag2">Without lifting your finger, drag across the screen to the last letter of the word.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_drag3">As you drag your finger around, the letters you are currently highlighting will turn yellow.  You can see the letter your finger is currently on in the top left corner of the screen (where the \"&lt;\" arrow usually is).</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_drag4">When you have highlighted the entire word (and no more than the entire word), lift your finger off the screen.  The word will then change to a different color in the grid and will be removed from the word list.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_trackball1">Roll the trackball around to find the first letter of a word.  The letter you are currently on is green.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_trackball2">When you are on the first letter of a word, click the trackball to start highlighting the word.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_trackball3">Roll the trackball to the last letter of the word and click the trackball again to find the word.  The word will change to a different color in the grid and will be removed from the word list.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tap1">Using your finger, tap the first letter of the word and lift your finger.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tap2">Using your finger, tap the last letter of the word.  The entire word will be highlighted and the word will be removed from the word list.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tap3">The letter is not selected until you lift your finger.  If, when you try to tap, you pick the wrong letter, don\'t lift up your finger--just drag your finger around the screen until you find the correct letter (use the letter box in the top-left corner if you need help) and lift your finger when you are over the correct letter.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tip1">You can also highlight a word starting from the last letter and ending on the first.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tip2">Use the \"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\" arrows to browse through the words in the current word list.  To change word lists, go to the menu and click on \"Word Bank.\"</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tip3">You can find any word in the word list, not just the one that is currently displayed</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tip4">If you are having trouble using tap or drag to highlight a word, go to the menu, click on \"Size\" and choose a grid with fewer letters (i.e. 7x7).  Because there are fewer letters, the letters are more spaced out and easier to pick with your finger.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tip5">If you are using the trackball, remember to click the trackball to begin and end finding a word.  if you do not click the trackball, the game does not know that you are trying to find a word.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tip6">Because the grid is randomly generated, you may see some words that are not part of the word list; you cannot highlight and \"find\" these words</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tip7">If you are using drag to highlight words, be careful not to drag your finger off of the touch screen.  Going off the touch screen is the same as lifting your finger.</string>
        <string name="ws_tutorial_message_tip8">When selecting a word using drag, the game will only highlight in yellow letters in a straight line going directly above, below, left, right, or diagonally between where you started highlighting and where your finger currently is.  If your finger is not in a direct line from the start letter, the highlight will not follow your finger until your finger returns to a direct line from the start letter.  The game will find the word that is highlighted, regardless of where your finger is when you lift it.</string>
